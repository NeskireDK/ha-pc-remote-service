# Planned Features

Goal: seamless couch gaming with a desktop PC that power-saves when not in use.
The PC is a multi-function machine — desktop (keyboard + mouse, multiple monitors) and
couch/TV (controller, living room display). Switching between these modes gracefully is
the core use case.

---

## Blockers

Documented bugs that undermine trust in the integration.

- [ ] **ThreadStateException throughout tray UI** — Root cause: `Main()` entry point is
  missing `[STAThread]`, so the process runs in MTA mode. COM/OLE calls anywhere in
  WinForms fail. The v1.3.1 `OnHandleCreated` fix deferred the symptom in `ModesTab`
  but didn't address the cause. Still throws in at least two places:
  - Games tab → clicking PC mode dropdown in `DataGridView` (`ComboBox.set_AutoCompleteSource`
    in `DataGridViewComboBoxCell.InitializeEditingControl`)
  - Modes tab → `ComboBox.set_AutoCompleteMode` in `ModesTab.OnHandleCreated`
  Fix: wrap entry point in explicit `static Program.Main()` with `[STAThread]`.
  Implemented locally, uncommitted. *(service)*

- [x] **PC auto-sleeps immediately after waking** — `GetLastInputInfo` idle counter is not
  reset by sleep/wake. After the PC wakes, the first inactivity check sees the accumulated
  pre-sleep idle time (often 5000+ s) and triggers sleep immediately. Fixed post-v1.3.2:
  subscribe to `SystemEvents.PowerModeChanged`; on `ResumeOrWake`, record the wake timestamp
  and cap reported idle to seconds-since-wake until real input resets the baseline. *(service)*

- [x] **Stop game: optimistic state not clearing** — After stop, the media player holds
  optimistic `playing` state for 30 s, but the game shows as still running beyond that
  window. Fixed: `_stop_issued_at` slides forward on each coordinator poll that still
  reports the game running, so the 30 s window only starts after the service confirms
  the game is gone. *(integration)*

- [x] **Artwork not loading** — Granular path logging added to the artwork endpoint: logs
  file size (KB), game name, and resolved path at each fallback step. Warning on missing
  file, Error on unexpected exceptions. Log level differentiation makes failures immediately
  visible without noise on the happy path. *(service)*

- [x] **Steam Big Picture launch idempotent** — Launching `steam-bigpicture` when Steam is
  already running does nothing. Fixed post-v1.3.2: launch via `steam://open/bigpicture` URI
  (via `xdg-open` / `ShellExecute`) instead of re-launching the Steam process. The URI is
  handled by the running Steam instance and switches to Big Picture regardless of current state. *(service)*

- [ ] **Footer button UX** — Apply/Save/Cancel buttons inconsistently positioned. Centralise
  in right-aligned footer across all tabs (General, Games, Power, Log). PC Modes tab is
  the exception (has its own row management buttons). *(service)*

- [ ] **Monitor switch: switching back to main display fails** — Switching to TV monitor works, but switching back to main display does not. Root cause unknown — may be a util/display-switching utility issue or a service-side issue. Needs debug logging added to the monitor-switch util response to understand what is returned when the reverse switch is attempted.

- [x] **General tab: Save + Restart → Apply with live reload** — No restart required.
  Kestrel stops, rebuilds on the new port, and restarts in-process. `KestrelRestartService`
  singleton wires the delegate from Program.cs into DI so GeneralTab can call it directly.
  No process relaunch, no UAC prompt. *(service)*


- [x] **Steam: tray 503** — `POST /api/steam/run/{appId}` returns 200 even when the tray
  is not running and no game launches. Fixed in service v0.9.0: `IpcSteamPlatform` throws
  `TrayUnavailableException` → endpoint returns 503. *(service)*

- [x] **Steam: running game not in source list** — `GetRunningGameAsync` falls back to
  `"Unknown ({appId})"` if the games cache isn't warm. Fixed in service v0.9.0:
  `GetRunningGameAsync` warms cache on first call and falls back to direct manifest
  lookup for games outside the top-20. *(service)*

---

## Architecture Refactor — Collapse Service + Tray into Single Process *(done in v0.9.1)*

### Background

The old architecture had a Windows Service (SYSTEM session) and a WinForms tray app (user session) communicating via named pipe IPC. Every meaningful feature required the user session anyway — audio, monitors, Steam, app launch. Collapsed everything into the tray process. Kestrel runs inside the tray. No IPC, no session boundary, no `TrayUnavailableException`. Linux gets a natural headless binary as well.

### Releases

#### ~~0.9.2~~ — Extract `HaPcRemote.Core` library *(shipped in v0.9.1)*

- [x] Create `HaPcRemote.Core` class library
- [x] Move services, interfaces, implementations, endpoints, models into Core
- [x] `HaPcRemote.Tray` references Core
- [x] Update test project references

#### ~~0.9.3~~ — Embed Kestrel in Tray, replace IPC with direct calls *(shipped in v0.9.1)*

- [x] Add ASP.NET Core / Kestrel hosting to `HaPcRemote.Tray`
- [x] Wire all Core services into Tray's DI container
- [x] Replace IPC wrappers with direct calls (`WindowsSteamPlatform`, `CliRunner`, `Process.Start`)
- [x] Migrate config path to `%AppData%\HaPcRemote\`

#### ~~0.9.4~~ — Delete Service project, IPC layer, update installer *(shipped in v0.9.1)*

- [x] Delete `HaPcRemote.Service` project
- [x] Delete IPC layer and wrappers
- [x] Update Inno Setup installer (no service registration, startup via all-users startup folder, config migration)
- [x] Update README

#### 0.9.5 — Linux foundation *(service repo)* *(done)*

Same binary, headless mode, systemd user service.

- [x] Wrap all WinForms/tray code behind `OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` / `[SupportedOSPlatform]`
- [x] Add Linux `IPowerService`: `systemctl suspend` or `loginctl suspend`
- [x] Add Linux `ISteamPlatform`: filesystem path (`~/.steam/steam/`), running game via VDF, launch via `xdg-open steam://run/<id>`
- [x] Add Linux audio (`pactl`-based `LinuxAudioService`)
- [x] Add headless entry point (Linux): plain Kestrel + mDNS, no tray icon, SIGTERM clean exit
- [x] Add systemd user service unit file to release artifacts
- [x] Add Linux build job to GitHub Actions CI
- [x] Document install steps in README

### Key decisions made

- **Why collapse?** Every feature requires the user session. IPC is complexity with no benefit.
- **Config path**: moves to `%AppData%` (user-owned, no elevation needed for reads/writes)
- **Native AOT**: dropped — framework-dependent is fine, .NET 10 auto-install already ships
- **Linux tray**: no system tray on Linux. API key via config file, logs via `journalctl`, updates via package manager — these are Linux-native equivalents, not a degraded experience.
- **Monitor profiles on Linux**: xrandr/Wayland too fragmented — skip initially, document as known gap

## v1.0

### 1. PC Mode — `POST /api/system/mode` + `select` entity *(done in v1.0)*

Single endpoint that atomically sequences audio output, monitor profile, volume, and
app launch/kill from a named config block.

```json
"Modes": {
  "couch": {
    "AudioDevice": "HDMI Output",
    "MonitorProfile": "tv-only",
    "Volume": 40,
    "LaunchApp": "steam-bigpicture"
  },
  "desktop": {
    "AudioDevice": "Speakers",
    "MonitorProfile": "desk-full",
    "Volume": 25,
    "KillApp": "steam-bigpicture"
  }
}
```

HA exposes a `select` entity "PC Mode" with options from `GET /api/system/modes`.
Selecting a mode calls the endpoint. The service handles sequencing and waits between
steps — no fragile automation chains.

- [x] Service: add `Modes` config section and `POST /api/system/mode` endpoint *(service)*
- [x] Service: add `GET /api/system/modes` to list available mode names *(service)*
- [x] Integration: `PcRemoteModeSelect` entity in `select.py` *(integration)*
- [x] Integration: `set_mode()` in `api.py` *(integration)*

### 2. Couch Gaming Automation Blueprint *(done in v1.0)*

Blueprint with selector inputs — no hard-coded entity names.

- [x] `blueprints/automation/pc_remote/couch_gaming.yaml` *(integration)*

### 3. Aggregated State Endpoint — `GET /api/system/state` *(done in v1.0)*

Single endpoint replaces the 6+ individual coordinator calls per poll cycle.

- [x] Service: add `GET /api/system/state` endpoint *(service)*
- [x] Integration: refactor `_async_update_data` to use single call *(integration)*

---

## v1.1

### 4. Post-Session Sleep Blueprint *(done in v1.0)*

When the Steam media player transitions `playing → idle`, wait N minutes, confirm
still idle, then sleep the PC. Closes the power-saving loop without manual action.

- [x] `blueprints/automation/pc_remote/post_session_sleep.yaml` *(integration)*

### 5. Media Browser for Steam Games + Apps *(done in v1.0.2)*

`select_source` works via developer tools / service calls but the dropdown only shows
in the entity detail dialog — not on dashboard cards. Add `browse_media` + `play_media`
support so Steam games (and later apps) appear in the HA media browser with thumbnails
and hierarchical navigation.

- [x] Integration: implement `async_browse_media()` returning `BrowseMedia` tree *(integration)*
- [x] Integration: implement `async_play_media()` to launch games/apps *(integration)*
- [x] Integration: add `BROWSE_MEDIA` + `PLAY_MEDIA` feature flags *(integration)*
- [x] Integration: add tests for browse/play media *(integration)*

### 6. User Idle Time Sensor *(done in v1.0.2)*

`GetLastInputInfo` Win32 API → seconds since last keyboard/mouse input.
Guards the sleep blueprint against sleeping a PC that someone is actively using at the desk.

- [x] Service: expose via `GET /api/system/idle` *(service)*
- [x] Integration: `sensor` entity "Idle Time" (device class `duration`) *(integration)*

### Settings Panel *(done in v1.1)*

Tabbed settings UI in the tray app: Modes, General, and log viewer.

- [x] Service: config panel with multiple tabs *(service)*
- [x] Service: PC mode config UI with dropdowns for monitor profiles, audio devices *(service)*
- [x] Service: general settings for log level *(service)*
- [x] Service: log viewer in settings panel *(service)*

---

## v1.2

### Bugs

- [x] **Kestrel status stuck on "Starting..."** — Fixed: synchronous fast path in
  `GeneralTab.UpdatePortStatus()` when `KestrelStatus.Started` is already completed. *(service)*

- [x] **Update race condition** — Fixed: `SemaphoreSlim` guard in `HandleDownloadAsync`
  prevents concurrent manual + auto-update downloads. *(service)*

- [x] **Update button color** — Fixed: removed stale `BackColor` reset. *(service)*

### 7. Rename Duration Sensor to Idle Duration *(done in v1.2)*

- [x] Service: renamed log message from "idle time" → "idle duration" *(service)*
- [x] Integration: renamed sensor to "Idle Duration" (`idle_duration` entity ID, translations, strings) *(integration)*

### 8. Non-Steam Game Discovery *(done in v1.2)*

Parses `shortcuts.vdf` (binary VDF via ValveKeyValue) to discover non-Steam game shortcuts.
Shortcuts merge into the game list with `IsShortcut` flag and launch via shifted
`steam://rungameid/` URI. CRC32-based appid generation matches Steam's algorithm.

- [x] Service: parse `shortcuts.vdf`, merge into game list, launch via shifted appid *(service)*
- [x] Integration: non-Steam games appear in media browser automatically (no changes needed — data flows through existing game list) *(integration)*

### 9. Steam Artwork / Poster Serving *(done in v1.2)*

`GET /api/steam/artwork/{appId}` serves game artwork from Steam's local cache.
Resolution order: custom grid art (`userdata/{steamid}/config/grid/{appId}p.*`) →
library cache (`appcache/librarycache/{appId}_library_600x900.*`). `SteamUserIdResolver`
discovers the active user via `loginusers.vdf`.

- [x] Service: artwork endpoint with grid → librarycache fallback *(service)*
- [x] Integration: media browser thumbnails use local artwork endpoint instead of Steam CDN *(integration)*

### 10. API Debug Page *(done in v1.2)*

Self-hosted HTML page at `GET /debug` (localhost-only, excluded from auth). Lists all
endpoints with method, path, description, and "Try it" buttons. API key auto-injected
via `<meta>` tag. Dark theme, no external dependencies.

- [x] Service: `/debug` endpoint, localhost-only, API key injection, endpoint catalog *(service)*
- [x] Tray: "API Explorer" context menu item *(service)*

### 11. Game-to-PC-Mode Binding *(done in v1.2)*

Per-game and default PC mode bindings. Mode switch executes before game launch.
Config in `Steam.DefaultPcMode` + `Steam.GamePcModeBindings`. Games settings tab
in tray with per-game dropdown.

```json
"Steam": {
  "DefaultPcMode": "couch",
  "GamePcModeBindings": {
    "730": "desktop",
    "1245620": "couch"
  }
}
```

- [x] Service: config, resolution logic (per-game → default → none), mode switch before launch *(service)*
- [x] Service: `GET/PUT /api/steam/bindings` endpoints *(service)*
- [x] Tray: "Games" settings tab with per-game mode dropdown *(service)*
- [x] Integration: `game_pc_mode_binding` attribute on media player entity *(integration)*

---

## v1.2.2

### 14. Steam Cold-Start Support

`steam_ready` in system state signals when Steam is up and ready. Prevents game launch
commands silently failing when Steam isn't running. Integration auto-launches Steam via
the existing app system and waits for readiness before sending the game command.

Auto-detects Steam path from registry on startup and writes a default `"steam"` app
config entry if missing — no manual setup required.

**Service:**
- [x] Add `SteamReady: bool` to `GET /api/system/state` response *(service)*
- [x] Add `UseShellExecute: bool` to `AppDefinitionOptions` (default `false`) *(service)*
- [x] Pass `UseShellExecute` through `DirectAppLauncher.LaunchAsync` *(service)*
- [x] On startup: detect Steam exe from registry, write default `"steam"` app entry (`-bigpicture` args) if not already configured *(service)*

**Integration:**
- [x] Read `steam_ready` from system state in coordinator *(integration)*
- [x] Cold path: replace fixed 15 s sleep with poll-until-`steam_ready` (max 2 min) *(integration)*
- [x] Warm path: check `steam_ready`; if false → launch `"steam"` app, wait for `steam_ready`, then launch game *(integration)*

---

## v1.3.1

### Bugs

- [x] **Opening settings throws `ThreadStateException`** — `ModesTab` constructor sets `AutoCompleteMode` on `ComboBox` controls before a window handle exists. In .NET 10, setting `AutoCompleteMode` requires STA and triggers an OLE call that fails when the handle isn't created yet. Triggered by any tray action that opens the settings form (double-click, right-click → Show Log, etc.). Fix: remove `AutoCompleteMode`/`AutoCompleteSource` from the constructor and apply them in `OnHandleCreated`. *(service)*

---

## v1.3.2

### Bugs

- [ ] **WinForms tray runs in MTA thread** — Top-level C# statements don't automatically
  apply `[STAThread]`, so the tray process runs in MTA mode. COM/OLE calls in WinForms
  (autocomplete, clipboard, drag-and-drop, file dialogs) require STA and will throw
  `InvalidOperationException` or `ThreadStateException` in MTA context. Root cause of the
  v1.3.1 `ThreadStateException` — the `OnHandleCreated` fix mitigated the symptom but not
  the cause. Fix: wrap entry point in an explicit `static Program.Main()` decorated with
  `[STAThread]`. Implemented locally, uncommitted. *(service)*

---

## v1.3

### Bugs

- [x] **Game artwork returns 401** — Fixed: added `/api/steam/artwork` prefix to `ExemptPaths` in `ApiKeyMiddleware`. *(service)*

- [x] **Non-Steam games show idle when launched via integration** — Fixed: when `GetRunningAppId()` returns 0, `GetRunningGameAsync` now scans running process paths against shortcut `ExePath` fields parsed from `shortcuts.vdf`. First match returns the `SteamRunningGame`. *(service)*

- [x] **turn_off connection error** — HA throws `CannotConnectError` on `switch/turn_off` and `media_player/turn_off` after sleep. PC suspends mid-request so `_TIMEOUT` fires → `TimeoutError` → `CannotConnectError` bubbles uncaught. Fixed: wrap `sleep()` in both `switch.py` and `media_player.py` to catch `CannotConnectError` and treat it as success. *(integration)*

- [x] **Tray "Log" menu item opens Power tab instead of Log tab** — Fixed: `ShowTab(4)` now correctly targets the Log tab. *(service)*

- [x] **Steam Big Picture not auto-registered as app entry** — Fixed: bootstrapper runs on every startup and writes both `"steam"` and `"steam-bigpicture"` entries if absent. *(service)*

- [x] **HACS install instructions missing repository step** — Fixed: README updated to include "Add custom repository" step with fenced code block. *(integration)*

- [x] **Info tooltip suppressed on click** — Fixed: `Click` event on `ⓘ` label now calls `ToolTip.Show()` with 3 s duration. *(service)*

- [x] **Games tab PC mode dropdown throws `ThreadStateException`** — Fixed: removed `AutoCompleteSource` from the in-grid `DataGridViewComboBoxColumn`. *(service)*

- [x] **Update check fails with "no such host: api.github.com"** — Fixed: `HttpRequestException` and `SocketException` caught and treated as "no update available". *(service)*

- [x] **Game launch buffers for ~3 minutes** — Fixed: game launch now uses the sustained 20 s WoL retry loop before polling for `steam_ready`. *(integration)*

- [x] **Stop game: be optimistic for 30 s** — Fixed: optimistic playing state held for 30 s after stop command. *(integration)*

---

## Backlog

### 12. Auto-Sleep on Inactivity *(done in v1.3)*

Auto-sleep the PC when it's been idle for a configurable duration. Conditions:
no game running, no mouse/keyboard/gamepad input for X minutes → sleep.

**Service-side:**
- Config: `Power.AutoSleepAfterMinutes` in `appsettings.json` (0 = disabled)
- Monitor loop: checks game state via `ISteamService` + input idle time via
  `GetLastInputInfo` / `loginctl` — if both exceed threshold, trigger sleep
- Power settings tab in tray with timeout slider/input
- `GET/PUT /api/system/power` endpoints to read/write config remotely

**HA integration:**
- Number entity "Auto-Sleep Timeout" to adjust minutes from dashboard
- Complements the post-session sleep blueprint (F4) which handles the
  "game just ended" case — this covers the broader "PC sitting idle" scenario

**Investigation — gamepad input detection:**
The current plan mentions gamepad integration as a prerequisite for detecting user activity. Investigate whether we can instead listen to gamepad connect/disconnect events (e.g. Windows `RawInput`/`XInput` device arrival, or Linux `udev` events / `/dev/input` monitoring) to infer activity without full gamepad integration. If connect/disconnect events are reliable enough (gamepad turns off when user is done), this could replace or supplement the `GetLastInputInfo` idle check without needing to read axis/button state.

```json
"Power": {
  "AutoSleepAfterMinutes": 30
}
```

- [x] Service: inactivity monitor loop + `Power.AutoSleepAfterMinutes` config *(service)*
- [x] Service: Power settings tab in tray *(service)*
- [x] Service: `GET/PUT /api/system/power` endpoints *(service)*
- [x] Integration: number entity for auto-sleep timeout *(integration)*

### 13. Help Tooltips for All UI Elements *(done in v1.3)*

Add contextual help to every setting in the tray app. Each field gets a `ToolTip`
with a small "ⓘ" icon label explaining what the setting does.

- [x] Service: add `ToolTip` component + help icons to Modes tab *(service)*
- [x] Service: add help icons to Games tab *(service)*
- [x] Service: add help icons to General tab *(service)*
- [x] Service: add help icons to Power tab *(service)*

---

### 19. Integration Brand Icons *(done in v1.3)*

HA 2026.3 supports bundling brand images directly in the custom integration — no external CDN or separate brands repo required. Local files take priority over CDN automatically.

`brand/` directory added under `custom_components/pc_remote/` with `icon.png` and `dark_icon.png`. Logo variants not included (not required by HA).

- [x] Integration: create `brand/` folder with `icon.png` and `dark_icon.png` *(integration)*

---

### 18. Steam Logo as Media Player Artwork When Idle *(done in v1.3)*

Shows the Steam icon (square, 960×960) when idle with no game running. Fetched once from
Wikimedia CDN on first request, then served from a module-level in-memory cache for the
lifetime of the HA session. Image is always proxied through HA (`media_image_remotely_accessible = False`).

- [x] Integration: `media_image_url` returns Wikimedia Steam icon URL when idle *(integration)*
- [x] Integration: `async_get_media_image()` overridden — returns cached bytes when idle, delegates to `super()` for game artwork *(integration)*

---

### 17. App Key Autocomplete for LaunchApp / KillApp in Modes Tab *(done in v1.3)*

`_launchAppCombo` and `_killAppCombo` now use `DropDownStyle.DropDown` with `AutoCompleteMode.SuggestAppend` — type a custom app key or pick from suggestions.

- [x] Service: change `_launchAppCombo` and `_killAppCombo` to `DropDownStyle.DropDown` with autocomplete *(service)*
- [x] Service: populate autocomplete source from `Apps` keys + well-known built-ins *(service)*
- [x] Service: update save logic to read `.Text` when `SelectedItem` is null (free-text path) *(service)*

---

### 16. Immediate Row Creation on "Add New" in PC Mode UI *(done in v1.3)*

When clicking New in the Modes tab, a blank placeholder row is immediately inserted and selected. Clicking Delete on the placeholder discards it without saving.

- [x] Service: Add inserts a blank placeholder row and selects it immediately *(service)*
- [x] Service: Form fields clear and bind to the new row on creation *(service)*
- [x] Service: Delete removes the uncommitted placeholder row *(service)*

---

### 15. Apply Button for Settings UI *(done in v1.3)*

Replace auto-save on change with an explicit Apply button. Settings are staged in memory and only written to disk when Apply is clicked. Discard/Cancel reverts unsaved changes.

- [x] Service: add Apply and Cancel buttons to each settings tab *(service)*
- [x] Service: defer config writes until Apply is clicked *(service)*
- [x] Service: Cancel/discard reloads current config from disk and resets form fields *(service)*

---

### Double-Click Tray Icon Opens Settings *(done in v1.3)*

- [x] Service: handle `NotifyIcon.DoubleClick` event and open the settings form *(service)*

---

### 20. Start Menu Shortcut *(done in v1.3.1)*

Add a Start Menu shortcut to the Inno Setup installer so users can find and launch the tray app by searching in the Start menu. Previously the app only auto-started via the startup folder with no searchable entry.

- [x] Service: add `[Icons]` entry to installer script creating a Start Menu shortcut for `HaPcRemote.Tray.exe` *(service)*

---

### Other

- [ ] Verify Linux headless daemon + systemd user service end-to-end *(service)*
