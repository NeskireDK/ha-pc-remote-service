HA PC Remote Service

This application runs as a Windows system tray app and exposes a local REST API that lets Home Assistant control your PC remotely.

Features:
  - Sleep / wake-on-LAN
  - Audio device and volume control
  - Monitor layout switching via saved profiles
  - Steam game tracking and launch

Companion Integration Required
-------------------------------
To use this service you need the "PC Remote" custom integration for Home Assistant,
available via HACS or at:

  https://github.com/NeskireDK/ha-pc-remote

After installing, go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration and search
for "PC Remote". If your PC is on the same network, it will be discovered automatically
via mDNS.

What this installer does:
  - Installs HA PC Remote to your chosen directory
  - Downloads SoundVolumeView and MultiMonitorTool (NirSoft, freeware)
  - Adds a firewall rule for the local API (port 5000)
  - Installs .NET 10 Desktop Runtime if not already present
  - Adds the tray app to Windows startup
